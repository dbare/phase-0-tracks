		<h1> Pied Piper </h1>
		<p> <strong>Pied Piper</strong> is a fictional compression company from the HBO show <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/"><em>Silicon Vally</em></a>.  Basically, the main character has a compression algorithm that is so much better than everyone elses, that he is launched into the insane world of the tech industry.  The show is both original <em>and</em> hilarious, I would recommend whatching it. </p>
