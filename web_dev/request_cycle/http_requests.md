2. 501, 502, 503, 504 these are the ones that I see most often and they refer to usually a server error of some kinda that you (as the user) cannot fix.  Where the error is coming from depends on wether the error is in the 100s, 200s, 300s, 400s, or 500s.

3. GET is for retrieving data and can only send limited amounts of data to the server.  POST submits data to be processed to a particual source.
